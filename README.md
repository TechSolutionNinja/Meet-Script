A Chrome Extension that gives you transcript of google meet. Start captions and all the script will be saved in chrome storage which can be downloaded in pdf format.



## Working

This extension doesn't recognize speech rather the speech-to-text conversion is done by google meet itself. So it is necessary to put captions on to get the transcript of the meet. The background script keeps on observing the captions and saves in google storage. When you click the download button it takes all the transcript which has been saved till that moment in the storage ,compiles it into pdf and then serves you.
